## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Added in the pictures and text needed and then played around with formatting for a cleaner final cut.

## Lessons Learned:

This was my first piece to specifically show off to freelance clients.  It gave me a good estimate of how long a project might take once I had all the pieces that I needed.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
